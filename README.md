# Exploring the Yeast Gene-Expression Landscape

- **Author:** Charukhesh  
- **Roll No:** AE22B028

## 📖 Project Overview

This project explores the landscape of gene expression data from the Yeast dataset, focusing on the challenges of high-dimensional, multi-label biological data. The analysis leverages advanced manifold learning techniques, **t-SNE** and **Isomap** to visualize and interpret the structure, imperfections, and class overlaps within the data. The notebook demonstrates how these dimensionality reduction methods reveal both local and global patterns, providing insights into noisy labels, outliers, and the intrinsic complexity of the classification problem.
